    <h1>The Best Asian Dramas in my opinions</h1>
<h2>My top 3 dramas of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>F4 Thailand Boys Over Flower</h3>
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13660288/"><img src="/4.3 HTML Porfolio Project/assets/images/f4-thailand.jpg" height="200"></img></a>
<p>Its a really good adaptation of the korean Version "Boys over Flower". The ML and Fl potrayed the story in a really good way. It is a great blend of Romance and comedy with a very very almost non existent love triangle which i am soo thankful for</p>
<h3>Love like a galaxy</h3>
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt21301278/"><img src="/4.3 HTML Porfolio Project/assets/images/love-like-a-galaxy.jpg" height="200"></img></a>
<p>This Cdrama is my number 1 rewatch of chinese dramas despite the fact that it makes we go through a rollercoaster of emotions the cdrama portrays a story of a young immature girl who matures significantly as the drama goes on</p>
<h3>Our beloved Summer</h3>
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15026724/"><img src="/4.3 HTML Porfolio Project/assets/images/our-beloved-summer.jpg" height="200"></img></a>
